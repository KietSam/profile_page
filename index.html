    <h2> <u> Biography </u> </h2>

     <p> Hi. My name is Kiet (pronounced Kit), I live here in Seattle,
        and I will be attending University of Washington (Seattle) with
        hopes of majoring in Computer Science. I like staying at home,
        manga, anime, Japanese anime music, Reddit, Top Gear (UK), and
        I've recently taken a liking to playing Sudoku when I'm waiting
        for the bus at bus stops. </p>

      <p> I'm a huge technology geek and to show that I've taken
        pride to my work space which has been updated year after
        year. I have 5 monitors in my room. 1 for surveillance
        outside my house, 3 for my computer, and one more for
        digital camera monitoring when filming videos. I have so
        many electrical outlets being used in my room that I'm afraid
        that someday my room will catch on fire. </p>

      <p> I've touched upon many things including video editing,
        photo editing, photography, designing, electrical, and programming. </p>

      <p> I'm an introvert and I never really "hang out" with
        people whenever I'm not in school so this will be an
        entirely new experience for me. I don't really know what
        to expect since this is so much outside my comfort zone
        but I hope I will learn a lot about myself from this.﻿ </p>
